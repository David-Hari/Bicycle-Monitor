* Somehow pipe console standard out/err to log file so I don't have to look at journalctl.
  If it can't be done in Python, set it up to re-direct to a different log file.
  Maybe then don't need PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 in bikemon.service

* Print or download pinout page and put on laptop




Python-Ant TODO:

* Only call callback on each new event, ignore identical messages
  in between. For example, a new power event should come on each crank rotation.
  Same for heart rate monitor.

* Log time of each bicycle power message.

* Startup message sometimes times-out after calling reset. Must have something to do with
  the driver, because it only happens in Node.start and never in Node.stop.
