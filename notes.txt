Bicycle-Monitor TODO:

* (Maybe) Use a mutex lock when updating all data and when drawing it to screen.

* Ant sometimes fails to start back up again once it's been shut down.
  Perhaps the shutdown does not happen properly.




Useful commands:

### Check temperature of CPU ###
> vcgencmd measure_temp
or
> cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp

### Check if GPS daemon is running ###
> sudo systemctl status gpsd.socket

### Test/debug GPS daemon ###
> sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
> sudo gpsd /dev/ttyUSB1 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
> cgps
> sudo killall gpsd

### Test video display ###
(currently set as hdmi_group=1, hdmi_mode=16 in /boot/config.txt)
list supported modes:
> tvservice –m CEA
> tvservice –m DMT
show current state:
> tvservice -s

### Bluetooth stuff ###
> sudo modprobe btusb
> sudo systemctl start bluetooth
> service bluetooth status
> service hciuart status
> bluetoothctl
  # power on
  # agent on
  # default-agent

### GPIO and other info (from gpiozero library) ###
> pinout



To run camera & display from command line, use:
> raspivid -t 0 -f --mode 5 -fps 49 -w 1296 -h 730 --flush









Python-Ant TODO:

* Only call callback on each new event, ignore identical messages
  in between. For example, a new power event should come on each crank rotation.
  Same for heart rate monitor.

* Log time of each bicycle power message.

* Startup message sometimes times-out after calling reset. Must have something to do with
  the driver, because it only happens in Node.start and never in Node.stop.
