Bicycle-Monitor TODO:

* Show multiple statuses on screen.
  Have a list of overlays.
  Adding new status will push existing overlays up. If there are too many, top
  ones will be removed.
  Each one will have a time-out, after which it will be removed from the list.

  showStatusText can return an id so that callers can call it again with that
  id and it wil update the existing text.
  If the overlay is still showing, it will reset the hide timer.
  If the overlay has been removed then it will just add a new one.

* Use a mutex lock when updating all data and when drawing it to screen.

* Ant sometimes fails to start back up again once it's been shut down.
  Perhaps the shutdown does not happen properly.


Python-Ant TODO:

* Only call callback on each new event, ignore identical messages
  in between. For example, a new power event should come on each crank rotation.

* Log time of each bicycle power message.

* Startup message sometimes times-out after calling reset. Must have something to do with
  the driver, because it only happens in Node.start and never in Node.stop.
