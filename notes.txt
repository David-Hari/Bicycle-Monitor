Bicycle-Monitor TODO:

* Use a lock

* Ant sometimes fails to start back up again once it's been shut down.
  Perhaps the shutdown does not happen properly.


Python-Ant TODO:

* Only call callback on each new event, ignore identical messages
  in between. For example, a new power event should come on each crank rotation.

* Log time of each bicycle power message.

* Startup message sometimes times-out after calling reset. Must have something to do with
  the driver, because it only happens in Node.start and never in Node.stop.
